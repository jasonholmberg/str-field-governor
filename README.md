# str-govern

I thought it would be interesting to experiment with a sort-of-declarative way to provide a way to scrub or format the return value of a method by configuring the method with a strategy to the work.

TODO:
 * Work in a switch so that the formatting does not always happen.
 * Experiment with a AuthorizationAwareGovernor.
